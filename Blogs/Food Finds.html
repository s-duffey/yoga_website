        <h1> Fresh Food Finds in Seattle </h1>
        
        <p> As an amateur, self-proclaimed foodie one of my favourite things to do while travelling is to sample the local cuisine. No trip is complete without a decent roster of cafes, dining experiences, market visits and a bit of nightlife! </p>

        <p> Now that I’ve been to Seattle several times over the past year I can safely say I’ve made a dent in the Seattle culinary scene, exploring multiple neighbourhoods and sipping on many, many coffees. If you’re planning a trip to the Emerald City anytime soon, I’ve curated a list of some of my favourites to add to your bucket list!  </p>
        
        <h2> Pike Place Market </h2>
        
        <figure class="image-center">
            <img src="../Images/Blog_Images/Food_Finds/Crabs.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image" alt="Fresh crabs sitting on ice in a market" width="500" height="425"> 
        </figure>

        <p> No trip to Seattle is complete without visiting the Pike Place Fish Market. Busy most days, and definitely a bit of a tourist trap, the market still has some must-visit hotspots. The Pike Place market is also a great place to start off your day, as it’s close to shopping, the piers and transit to take you all around the city.  </p>
        
        <p> Here’s a list of my favourite finds as well as a few stops to skip. </p>
        
        <p><b> World Market:</b> Located just a couple blocks from the main hub of the market, this large general store has a wide mishmash of interesting finds. From ethnic foods and treats, to imported furniture and barware, the World Market is always a great place to pick up some snacks, wine and other oddities to enjoy during your trip. If you can, go with someone local so you can get their discounted prices!  </p>

        <div class="image-right">
            <img src="../Images/Blog_Images/Food_Finds/robot%20v%20sloth.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image" alt="Cartoon art of a sloth shaking hands with a unicorn">
            <p><b><a href="https://www.cedarandspokescoffee.com/"> Cedar and Spokes Coffee:</a></b> This interesting little corner cafe has a super minimal aesthetic and, of course, great coffee. This is my favourite spot to sit for a while with my laptop to write or make plans for the rest of my trip. Don’t forget to snap a super clean photo for your Instagram </p>

            <p><b>Market Spice:</b>  A super packed spice shop tucked away behind the main fish bar. You can fulfill all your spice needs here as well as pick up some delicious loose leaf tea and exotic blends. </p>
            
            <p><b><a href="https://www.robotvsloth.com/">Robot vs. Sloth:</a></b> Confession: not a food place. Not related to food at all actually but DEFINITELY a must-see. This fun shop on the corner of First and Pine has some super cute art, stickers and other swag from local artists. A totally unique and quirky place to get souvenirs. My favourite is always the watercolour magic from Odd Fauna - but all the art there will make you giggle. </p>
        </div>
        
        <p> Places to avoid:</p>
        <p> <b>Seattle’s “first” Starbucks:</b> You’ll know it from the massive line down the street. This Starbucks on Pike Place street is often cited as the first Starbucks in Seattle, but that’s not actually true. While there is some unique Starbucks swag here, it’s just not worth the line (and probably available elsewhere). Use your time at literally any other coffee shop in the city - you’ll appreciate it. </p>
        <p><b>Pike Place Chowder:</b> While pretty famous as some of the best chowder in Seattle, I’ve been served some pretty great bowls in other places as well. Again, the lines here are just not worth it. If you really want the real deal, you can always order online instead! </p>
        
        <h2> Staple Seafood </h2>
        <div class="image-left">
            <img src="../Images/Blog_Images/Food_Finds/Taylors.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image" alt="Clams with breadcrumbs on a plate">
            <p> I had NO IDEA I even liked seafood until I visited the West Coast, and I really started to love it after a couple of trips to Seattle. Seafood is just so amazing when it’s fresh and the Pacific Northwest knows best. Seafood pretty much anywhere is going to be fantastic, but here are a couple staple places to check out.  </p>
        
            <p><b><a href="https://www.taylorshellfishfarms.com/">Taylor’s Shellfish and Oyster Bar:</a></b>  This was a pretty pricey meal, but the freshness of the fish was unrivalled and it’s location next to Seattle Center is super convenient for a day spent at MoPop. I’m not personally a fan of oysters, but I got some raw tuna here and it was so soft and buttery. Definitely worth it!  </p>
        
        </div>
        
        <p><b>Ivar’s Acres of Clams:</b>  This is your go-to spot for good seafood and a lot of it. With some mega-meal options and other fine dining plates, this place is great for groups with varying tastes. The restaurant is also HUGE and has some fun history in the lobby.  </p>
        
        <p><b>Fish and chips:</b> it doesn’t matter where you get them, just make sure you don’t leave the city without getting some. Seattle fish and chips are amazing and made like no where else. Honestly, I got some at a fast-food style place in the mall and they were perfect.  </p>
        
        <figure class="image-center">
            <img src="../Images/Blog_Images/Food_Finds/fish%20and%20chips.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image" alt="Crispy fish and chips on a white plate" width="500" height="425"> 
        </figure>
        
        <h2> Unique Places </h2>
        
        <p> There’s some places that offer truly unique dishes and experiences that felt chic and fun. Since my parents live in Belltown, I get to check out some of the most hopping streets for dining and nightlife. Here’s a couple that are totally worth the splurge. </p>
        
        <div class="image-right">
            <img src="../Images/Blog_Images/Food_Finds/Lady%20Yum.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image" alt="Purple and green macaron sitting on a glass table">
                     
        <p><b><a href="https://taqueriacantina.com/"> Taqueira Cantina:</a></b> Mexican restaurants are pretty common anywhere on the west coast, and much different and more traditional than anything you’ll find in Ottawa. Taqueira Cocina is a great place mostly because it’s just down the street from my parents’ place and the margaritas are super fun. On a fluke we also found out they have great happy hour deals on taco Tuesdays! </p>
        
        <p><b><a href="https://www.umisakehouse.com/">Umi Sake House:</a></b> This Belltown sushi bar was really hoppin’ on a Friday night! At first we were worried we weren’t going to get a table without a reservation, but the hostess then brought us back into the restaurant which was way larger than expected. This sushi dinner was definitely a treat, with uber fresh rolls and luxury drinks to pair them with ( I got an Elderberry Champagne which was lovely). We stuck to basic rolls but they had all sorts of unique combinations too. </p>
        
            <p><b><a href="https://www.ladyyum.com/">Lady Yum:</a></b> If you’re looking to satisfy your sweet tooth, make the trip to Lady Yum after a visit to the Amazon Spheres. This adorable little macaron shop has a huge array of colourful macarons. We went for a late night treat, where they also serve champagne to accompany your colourful dessert. The staff here was SO friendly and gave us lots of samples. Bonus: the wallpaper made me squee with joy. </p> </div>
        
        <h2> Nightlife </h2>
        
        <div class="image-right">
            <img src="../Images/Blog_Images/Food_Finds/Navy%20Strength.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image" alt="A flaming tiki drink on a table">
            
            <p> You can’t make a trip to Seattle without sampling some of the eclectic or higher-end nightlife (sometimes both in one night). A vibrant “underground” scene that’s reminiscent of the grunge era, paired with the high-class luxury bars to match the up and coming foodie scene makes for a fun match that’s nothing but pure Seattle. I’ve spent a few nights bar hopping around Belltown and Lower Queen Anne, and here were some highlights. </p>
        
            <p> <b><a href="https://www.navystrengthseattle.com/"> Navy Strength: </a></b> This fun and chill tiki bar on 2nd Avenue was a great place to stop for a real date. Their cocktail menu is just spectacular with classic tropical favourites and a rotating set of cocktails inspired from different parts of the world. Without even knowing we were in for a show, Ethan ordered a drink that came with fire and sparks! The drinks here were pretty pricey, but worth it for a nice conversation and the production value. </p>
        
            <p><b> Cursed Oak: </b> A dark and cozy bar with lots to choose from. This is a small place on the corner of 2nd Avenue and Blanchard Street, with classic whiskey cocktails. It was a great place to start our night out on the town and engage in some deep conversation before we got too many drinks in our system.  </p>
            
        </div>
        
        <p><b> Jupiter Room: </b> I can’t speak to the drinks since we didn’t actually buy any here, but this basement arcade was a lot of fun. With several rows of pinball machines, Pac-Man and others, Ethan and I spent some time popping quarters and pressing buttons. Definitely a must-stop on your bar hop. </p>
        
        <p><b><a href="https://www.keysonmain.com/">Keys on Main: </a></b> This is an amazing place to spend the whole night. Piano bars are pretty abundant around Seattle, but this one had fantastic talent for a random weeknight! The piano players were full of comedy, the drinks were cheap and the crowd was totally hooked. A super fun time with a friend or a group, but bring lots of bills if you’re going to request songs! </p>
        
        <h2> Coffee and Breakfast </h2>
        
        <p> Seattle equals coffee, and the coffee in Seattle is strong. There’s nothing quite like waking up on a misty morning and stopping in on the first coffee shop you find, knowing it’s going to be fantastic. I’ve never had a coffee or breakfast sandwich in Seattle that didn’t immediately get me up and going. Here are some ones worth seeking out. </p>
        
        <p><b> Citizen Creperie:</b> If you’re looking for a bigger breakfast to start your day, this is the place. With both sweet and savory crepes, and a fantastic cup of black coffee, you can’t go wrong. We stumbled upon this place before picking up our rental car and we had more than enough fuel to last us through a day of hiking and adventuring. </p>
        
        <div class="image-left">
            <img src="../Images/Blog_Images/Food_Finds/Cherry%20Street.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image" alt="A coffee and a bagel sandwich">
                 
            <p><b><a href="https://www.cherryst.com/"> Cherry Street: </a></b> Everyone knows Seattle for the birth of Starbucks, but there’s also a bunch of other great chains around the city. Cherry Street is one of the most popular and is super easy to find every few blocks or so. The coffee actually has a hint of cherry flavour and the bagels are super tasty and fresh! </p>
        
            <p><b>Seattle Grind:</b>This tiny corner cafe was surprisingly good. Located in the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation building near Seattle Center, it’s easy to miss but worth seeking out. The one barista was a super friendly guy and chatted with us the whole time he was brewing and toasting. The breakfast sandwiches were super filling and this was overall a great start to the morning. </p>
        
        </div>
        
        <p><b>Honourable mention - <a href="https://www.starbucksreserve.com/en-us/locations/seattle">  Starbucks Reserve Roastery: </a></b> While generally I would say avoid Starbucks on a trip to its birthplace, the Reserve Roastery in Capitol Hill is definitely an interesting tourist stop-in. With a huge array of unique roasts, coffee accessories and other swag, it’s a great place to pick up some souvenirs for your favourite Starbucks fanatic (we all have one). Be ready to spend some time here because the place is packed, and you’ll want to enjoy a wood oven pizza or a flight of different coffees. Don’t forget to grab some photos for the ‘Gram too while you’re at it. </p>

        </figure>
        
        <p> Overall, exploring restaurants, local cuisine and nightlife is fantastic on any trip, it’s definitely a highlight when visiting Seattle. With the strongest coffee anyone could hope for, a bustling food scene and a long history of unique bars and concert experiences, you’ll never be bored of all the choices.  </p>
