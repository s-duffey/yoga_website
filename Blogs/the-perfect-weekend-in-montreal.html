        <h1> The Perfect Weekend in Montreal </h1>
             
                   <p> One of my favourite things about Montreal is how unassuming the entrances to restaurants, shops and venues appear to be. But once you walk inside, you are almost always transported to somewhere new. Small-looking entrances lead into bustling brunch spots, lively bars, and cozy boutiques filled with curiosities. If Montreal needed a motto, I would go for “never judge a place by its (seemingly insignificant) door!” </p> 
        
         <figure class="image-center">

        </figure>
                   <p> Besides all the gems in plain sight, the buzz of Montreal is infectious. Even in cooler weather the streets are lively with young party-goers, and the tourist areas are filled with gorgeous architecture and scenic views. Because Montreal is so multicultural, you’ll never get tired of going out for dinner. A mix of different cuisines and a new vibe in each place will keep you on your toes.  </p>
        <p> If you like food, alcohol, music and lively people, Montreal is the place for you.</p>

        <p> Read on for my perfect weekend - a mix of chill afternoon wandering, and quintessential Montreal nightlife.</p>
        
                
        
        
        <h2> Friday Nightlife </h2>
        
        <p> Arrive in Montreal, and get settled in quickly. You won’t want to wait to get out and explore the city after dark. Known for its amazing nightlife, spend a few hours bar hopping in Montreal and you’ll have a night you won’t soon forget.</p>
        

        <p> While you can explore amazing nightlife any day of the week in Montreal, there will certainly be tons of options on any given Friday. There are two places you’ll quickly become familiar with when it comes to Montreal nightlife: Le Quartier des Spectacles / Red Light District (Between Blvd St. Laurent and Rue St. Denis) and Le Village (Rue St. Catherine, northeast of UQAM). </p>
        
        
        <p>In the Red Light District/ Le Quartier des Spectacles, Blvd Saint-Laurent features tons of gritty entertainment and lively restaurants. Kick-ass rock shows, strip clubs, and cheap drunk food (looking at you La Belle Province) abound.</p>
        
              <p> My absolute favourite to look into on any trip to Montreal is <a href="https://clubsoda.ca/">Le Club Soda</a>. A versatile entertainment venue, Club Soda hosts stand-up comedy, tribute bands, as well as local and internationally recognized artists. Tickets usually need to be purchased in advance, but are always super affordable! </p>

        </figure>

                <p> Between Saint-Laurent and Saint-Denis the entertainment venues and restaurants are abundant, so take a walk, and find somewhere with loud music.  </p>
            
            <p> Le Village and surrounding area along Rue st. Catherine, hosts a variety of upscale clubs, cozy resto-bars and loud and proud entertainment. For a cozy bar experience, I’d recommend <a href="https://www.restokeela.ca/?lang=en">Resto-Keela</a>, where the wine selection is superb and the staff are even better.</p>
        

        <p> For entertainment, it doesn’t really get better than a drag show at <a href="http://www.mado.qc.ca/">Cabaret Mado</a>. Montreal is known for its community of drag queens and queer performers, and Cabaret Mado hosts some of the best. The queens here will keep you entertained all night long for a cheap cover charge. </p>
        
                  <h2> Saturday: All about Mont-Royal</h2>
        
        <div class="image-left">
                <img src="../Images/Blog_Images/the-perfect-weekend-in-montreal/the-perfect-weekend-in-montreal-6.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image" alt="A view of the entrance to the Redpath Museum on the McGill Campus">
            
  
    
        
        <p> On Saturday there’s no doubt you’ll want to take it easy after your night of partying. This is the perfect time to go for a late morning walk around the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill Campus</a>. As a top-ranked student city, downtown Montreal is filled with eager students and coffee shops all around the university. With it’s beautiful architecture and quiet sitting areas, a small stroll around McGill will wake you up slowly.</p>
        
                
    <p> When you’re ready to eat something, check out <a href="https://www.aunja.com/">Cafe Aunja</a>. This Persian cafe has some fun specialties like the Iced Persian Fog, or mint lemonade.  </p>
        
        <p> Caffeinated and ready to go, spend an afternoon in <a href="https://www.lemontroyal.qc.ca/en">Mont Royal Park</a>. Right in the heart of the city, this large green space features the Kondiaronk Belvedere, with iconic views of the Montreal skyline. If you’re up for more of a hike, spend your afternoon sitting by Beaver Lake, relaxing in this bustling green space. </p>
       
        <p> If it’s raining, check out the <a href="https://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/">Montreal Museum of Fine Arts</a> instead.</p>
        
         
            <p>For a casual dinner, visit <a href="https://www.bargeorge.ca/">Bar George</a>. This modern English restaurant features upscale cocktails and traditional English and Scottish fare. The decor is really the best asset here though! Located in Le Mount Stephen Hotel, this grand heritage mansion is a romantic setting to sit for hours.</p></div>
        
                       <h2> Sunday: Industrial Magic </h2>
        
      
            <div class="image-right">
                <img src="../Images/Blog_Images/the-perfect-weekend-in-montreal/the-perfect-weekend-in-montreal-3.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image" alt="A large white sculpture with a backdrop of skyscrapers. The sculptur is a human figure made of white wires.">
                
        
        <p> For your last day in Montreal, it’s time to explore some of the more industrial neighbourhoods. Located close to the Lachine Canal, the neighbourhoods of Little Burgundy and Griffintown offer the charm of both quintessential Montreal triplexes, and more modern condo buildings.</p>
        
        <p> Start your day right with a Sunday brunch at <a href="https://www.perlesetpaddock.com/">Perles & Paddock</a>. This lively and cozy restaurant and bar offers all kinds of espresso and re-imagined brunch classics, like chicken and waffles with red pepper jelly. You can’t really go wrong here. </p>
        
        <p> After a slow brunch, spend some time antique shopping in Little Burgundy along Rue de Notre-Dame O. Speciality stores like <a href="https://lampiste.com/">Lampiste</a>, or Antiquites L’Ecuyer are super fun for a bit of window shopping. </p>
        
        <p> In the afternoon, take a walk or bike along the Lachine Canal. This historic canal goes right along  Griffintown all the way to the Vieux-Port.  It’s perfect for a Sunday bike ride, or a longer walk along the path. </p>
        
        <p> When you make it to Vieux-Port, pick up some souvenirs at the <a href="https://www.marchebonsecours.qc.ca/en/">Bonsecours Market</a> before heading home. </p></div>
        
        
        <h2> Book your train ticket </h2>
        
        <p> If this sounds like an amazing weekend to you, what are you waiting for? Montreal has so much to offer for both residents, tourists and day-trippers alike.</p>
        
        <p> When travelling to Montreal, you can’t really beat taking the Via Rail train. With its central station located in the heart of downtown, you are immersed in the city the moment you arrive. </p>

      <h3> Why Everyone Should Travel Solo At Least Once </h3>
        <p> In early 2018 I took my first leap into travelling and I decided to go for it solo. Travelling is something I knew I always wanted to do but for years I was always able to find an excuse not to book my first trip... </p>
