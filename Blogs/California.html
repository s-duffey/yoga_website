                <p> In early 2018 I took my first leap into travelling and I decided to go for it solo. Travelling is something I knew I always wanted to do but for years I was always able to find an excuse not to book my first trip. One of my biggest excuses was that I didn’t want to go alone – it was too scary, too dangerous, too lonely – you name it. Travelling on my own just seemed far away, like it was meant for people who were far more adventurous and courageous than I was. </p>
                </div>

            <p> But after leaving my first relationship of five years, I had to learn to be on my own again, to totally redefine who I was as an individual. My first solo trip was a huge key to starting that process and it made me realize that I didn’t really need a reason to ignite my love for travel and follow that dream. While I needed the big change of a breakup to finally get the courage to book a flight, I now strongly believe that everyone should travel solo at least once, no matter your situation.Here’s why: </p>
        
            <h2> Travelling solo allows you to dig deeper into the things you love and why. </h2>

            <p> By choosing your destination and creating your own itinerary you get to really reflect on the place and activities that speak to you. At the time, a trip to San Francisco felt like a random choice for me, but after just a couple days in the city I realized it is a place that truly embodies my personality. The colours of the city, the gardens, and the mix of urban life and breathtaking nature were all things that make me really happy. I didn’t really have to do much in San Francisco to have a good time. Just a slow walk through some beautiful gardens or a quick look at the ocean was enough to light me up. When you get the chance to prioritize and make your own choices about your trip, the things you love on a really deep level tend to reveal themselves to you. </p>

            <h2> You surprise yourself with your ability to problem-solve, and you gain a whole new independence because of it. </h2>

            <div class="image-right">
                <img src="../Images/Blog_Images/California/California-7.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image" alt="Car driving down a highway in a forest">
                <p> Whether you’re travelling solo or not, every trip comes with some surprises. As a solo traveler, when things don’t go as planned all you have to depend on is your own problem-solving skills and gut instincts. You’ll definitely be surprised at how great those skills already are without you needing to think about it too much.  </p>
            </div>

            <p> When I was in California, I took a road trip down the Pacific Coast Highway. Driving along ocean cliffs for several days on your own is daunting enough already, but by day two my road trip got totally sidetracked due to mudslides. In the middle of Big Sur with no cell service, I made the quick decision to make the trip back to the city instead of taking the extra long round-about route. In the same day I drove up (and down) a dirt mountain road, found last-minute accomodations via Airbnb, and parked on a hill after driving through San Francisco rush hour. I was super proud of myself and in the moment, I didn’t really have time to feel afraid. After making it through that fiasco and everything turning out better than ever, I definitely felt like I could take on anything life might throw at me in the future. </p>
        
            <h2> Exploring a place alone gives you more room for spontaneity, meeting people, and digging deep. </h2>
        
            <p> When you’re on your own in a new place you have ultimate flexibility and can seize opportunities that come your way. One night in downtown San Francisco I was planning on doing some night photography when a charity recruiter started chatting with me. Normally at home I walk by and wave these people off, but with flexible evening plans and the interesting fact that I wasn’t from here, I was open to meeting someone new. I ended up spending a lot of time with Emilio throughout the trip, met his friend June, and threw a bunch of my plans out the window. With Emilio and June to show me around I got a truly local experience that was much better than whatever I had planned anyway. </p>
        
            <p> The two of them gave me an insider tour of the most interesting places in the Castro and introduced me to the pros and cons of San Francisco life and its diverse arts culture. June even brought me to an intimate poetry slam where I got to witness raw emotion and experiences of diverse youth living in the city. None of these communities or experiences are easily available to most tourists and I definitely never would have pursued them if I was travelling with a group. </p>

            <h2> What are you waiting for? Book your first solo trip! </h2>
            
            <p> Overall, I’m never going to deny that travelling solo for the first time is a scary idea, but it’s one-hundred percent worth it! Travelling solo gave me more confidence than anything else and it allowed me to define my own interpretations of what being a “traveler” looks like. As I travel to more places on my own, I’m starting to learn the things I love about solo travel and the things I don’t. But I would never trade these trips for ones with friends or family instead. Each destination has given me the chance to prove my own capabilities and meet locals who give me a true taste of the cultures I’m visiting. </p>
