        <p> Over the past few weeks I've been packing up my clothes and selling old furniture and books. That's because I'm moving - for the fifth time in 5 years. As stressful and labor-intensive as moving can be, I actually kind of love it. Moving forces you to evaluate your things, decide what's worth the effort to move, and understand how you want to start fresh in your new space. It's the perfect time to introduce true minimalism into your life. </p>
        
        <p> Lately I've been obsessed with the ideas and practices behind minimalism. Minimalism focuses on cleaning out your things, but also looks at other aspects of life too, and emphasizes slowing down, consuming and living in a way that is true to your values, and creating more space (and time) for things you actually enjoy. As an added benefit, minimalism is so good for lowering your impact on the environment and living more sustainably. </p> 
        
        </div>
        
        <p> When moving into a new place, minimalism is the perfect approach to take because you need to go through your things and adapt to changes anyway! Here are some of the ways I've applied minimalism while moving. </p>
        
        <p><b> Pro tip: don't move 5 times in 5 years.</b></p>
        
        <h2> Marie Kondo-ing my whole house </h2>
        
        <div class="image-right">
            <img src="../Images/Blog_Images/Minimalism/minimalism_2.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image" alt="A liptstick tube, jar of cream, blueberries and a lime on a wooden background. ">

        <p> When moving, paring down your things tends to be pretty extreme. It also means you have to look at the items in your home that you don't clean out or use that often. When getting around to these stranger categories I pick a drawer, dump it all into the middle of the room and figure out what to keep. Sometimes it can be a long and difficult process, but for some categories I find it easy to throw things in the “don’t keep” pile. These piles are long overdue for a clean up, and being able to sort so quickly is really liberating! </p>

        <p> So many things are  not worth packing up, so I like this method because it forces me to evaluate what is useful to me or what I love. It's also the only way to streamline those bigger collections of things like clothes, lotions or makeup, because it puts everything out in the open and forces you to compare. When you have similar items right next to each other, it's clear which one you like best. Then it's easy to donate or sell the rest! </p>
        
        <p><b> Pro tip: One trick I often use is to pile a bunch of like items together. If I'm finding it hard to choose I'll leave the items in a pile for a week and see which one I use first. That's the one I keep.</b></p>
        </div>
        
        <h2> A fresh space means a fresh start </h2>
        
        <div class="image-left">
            <img src="../Images/Blog_Images/Minimalism/minimalism_3.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image" alt="A couch in a stylish living room with windows in the back shining light into the room.">
        
        <p>There's something about walking into a new and empty home on the first day that's liberating, and starting to furnish that place from scratch is a process that I enjoy.</p>
        
        <p> I love interior decorating and choosing colour combinations. When I get the keys to my new home, I love creating floor plans and planning out how I want to decorate the new space. Having less things to start with means I can focus on my favourite furniture or accent pieces first, decorate around them, and find a home for everything else. </p>
        
        <p> When you start to envision your ideal space it becomes easy to identify what doesn’t fit or work for you anymore. This means that a lot of items that I did move with me end up in a donation pile too. When unpacking, if something doesn’t have a clear home or doesn’t work in that room - it makes sense to give it away to someone who could make better use of it.</p>
            
        </div>
        
        <p> Having a well decorated and clean home also gives incentive to keep it that way! This is such a huge bonus and one of the most fun parts about moving into a new home. Starting with a clean place means you’re more likely to keep it clean (at least for a while) and it gives you a chance to streamline some of those areas or collections that you know tend to get cluttered. Having a clean home makes me feel good. And when I’m proud of my space, I’m more likely to invite friends and family over and leave space for hobbies and items that bring me joy.</p>
        
        <p><b> Pro tip: plan your decorations and space beforehand so you're not buying new decorations when you're out and about. For bold and colourful items, choose things that are easy to change later, like cushions or linens.</b></p>
        
        <h2> Developing new routines </h2>
        
        <p> Finally, after the excitement of moving day, spending some time to explore the neighbourhood is a fun way to make your new place feel like home. After moving in, I do a lot of research on the neighbourhood, joining social media groups, blogs or newsletters to local shops and event spaces. Doing your research online or by walking around gives you a good sense of which places and communities are going to integrate well into your lifestyle.</p>
        
        <div class="image-right">
            <img src="../Images/Blog_Images/Minimalism/minimalism_4.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image" alt="A close-up look of an office space with birch cabinets and a black chair with a pink blanket.">
        
        <p> This is also a great chance to evaluate your current habits and see if you can try out new ones, like taking public transit instead of driving, shopping at a local farmer’s market instead of a box store, or visiting a small coffee shop instead of a chain. If you live in a neighbourhood that supports small and local business, has a solid transit system, and plenty of outdoor space, you’re in a good position to incorporate more sustainable and environmentally friendly habits into your daily routine. </p>
        
        <p> One thing I always make sure to check in on are the recycling rules and practices for my new building. Because garbage and recycling rules change between owners, it’s important to know what you can recycle, how to sort your items and the limitations on your garbage. I also do a quick check when I move in to see if there are any small appliances or changes I can make to save energy in my new unit. Lightbulbs and shower heads are some key things to look for. </p>
        
        </div>
        
        <p> Your neighbourhood makes a big difference in the environmental impact of your routine, but your unit should be the number one place to start! You use these items and appliances everyday so making them as efficient as possible from the get go ensures you’ll have more sustainable routines and consumption before you even leave your front door.</p>

        <p><b> Pro tip: try taking a different route for a while each time you commute or go for a walk. Then you'll get to know the neighbourhood, local businesses and markets where you can buy more environmentally friendly essentials.</b></p>
        
        <h2> Being minimalist every day </h2>
        
        <p> You don't have to be moving to transition to a more minimal lifestyle! Creating some guidelines, events or fun activities around cleaning up can make it a regular habit. I've heard of lots of people who do clothing exchanges with their friends, a leftover dinner once a week or turn a spring cleaning weekend into a fun day with music and fresh air.</p>
        
        <p> It's also never too late to do some research about your own environmental impact and how you could make it better. recycling rules change or a new business opens up that gives you more options for buying local. Keeping up with changes in your neighbourhood allows you to adapt your lifestyle and add some new routines that could help you live a little simpler.</p>
        
        <p><b> Pro tip: read up on minimalism and how to live and buy items using your values. Use the changing seasons, a life change or some other excuse to set aside a day for cleaning and researching new sustainable opportunities.</b></p>

      <h3> Why Everyone Should Travel Solo at Least Once (Big Sur) </h3>
        <p> In early 2018 I took my first leap into travelling and I decided to go for it solo. Travelling is something I knew I always wanted to do but for years I was always able to find an excuse no to book my first trip. One of my biggest excuses was that I didn’t want to go alone... </p>
