                   <p> Okay let’s just put this out there - meditation is hard. But there’s a reason so many people continue to do it. The effects of a regular meditation practice on mental and physical health are truly life-changing.</p> 
                   <p> Eastern cultures have known this for centuries, but more recently, psychologists, neurobiologists and other researchers have proven that mediation has a ton of benefits. From literally changing the biology of the brain, to subjective reports of feeling healthier and happier, there are some pretty solid reasons why meditation should become part of our regular routine. </p>
        <p> But I get it - meditation is a challenge. Finding the time, or the motivation to do it takes practice to overcome. And even when I am able to incorporate it into my daily routine - there are so many days where I feel like it’s just not “working” the way it should. </p></div>

        <p> But after 6 years of practicing yoga and meditation, and gradually focusing more on my meditative and spiritual practices, I’ve noticed a HUGE difference in my own approach to life. Over time, meditation has given me a sense of peace like nothing else can, it has made me more compassionate and empathetic. Meditation grounds me, helps me make better decisions, and helps me navigate some really big challenges with mental illness. I cannot praise it enough, yet each and every day I humbly remember that it is a PRACTICE, and it is really about the journey more than the end results.  </p>
        
        <p> I’m no expert, but if you want to get started, or want to build on an existing meditation practice, here are some tricks that have worked wonders for me. </p>
        
        <h2> It's Okay to Move</h2>
        
        <p> What do you think of when you think of meditation? Do you envision yourself sitting on a cushion, perfectly still, mind clear? On some days that’s what it looks like, but honestly that’s pretty rare. To me, as I’ve practiced more and more I’ve realized that meditation happens while in the midst of another activity. Usually I’m most meditative when I’m doing yoga - even some of the most basic movements. Other times I actually feel meditative when I’m out hiking, or paddling, or sometimes even cooking or cleaning.  </p>

            <figcaption> Being near the water always brings my mind to a more meditative state. </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> The point is, meditation doesn’t mean being perfectly still and thought-free. It’s more fluid than that. The physical body and the mind play with each other and influence each other constantly. While some days you may be able to sit still for a period of time, other days you may feel restless. I’m here to tell you that it’s okay to move. In fact, moving your body may lead to a more meditative state. Whether it’s through a yoga flow, weight lifting, gentle stretches or something else entirely - move your body. Get out of your head a little so that you are able to transition into a more peaceful state.  </p>
        
        <p>Meditation is also great to do before a movement practice if you want to ground yourself and center yourself. Heck, you can even throw it in the middle. Meditate a little, see how you feel. Move for 15 minutes, meditate again. You’ll probably notice a difference. </p>
        
        <p> Our bodies are not barriers to clear thought, they can be the conduit to it. </p>

            <h2> Even When It Doesn't Feel Like It's Working, It Is</h2>
                <p> The days your mind is busiest, are the days you probably need meditation the most. It will be challenging to sit down and start. Use your go-to techniques on these days to make it easier. Keep it short. </p>
            <p> The thing about meditation is that it often doesn’t feel like it’s working. But it is. When you’re sitting in place, trying to clear your mind, it’s ok if you don’t get there. In fact, the more you try to get to perfectly clear headspace, the harder it will be to “get there”. Meditation isn’t actually about clearing your head at all, but observing and exploring the thoughts that are already there. If you sit long enough, you may find your mind gets a bit clearer, but that’s just an effect, not a goal. </p>
        </div>

        <p> As long as you are taking the time for yourself to actually meditate - to sit with your thoughts and become more mindful of your body in space - you are already doing it “right”. Appreciate that. Acknowledge it. And then let the magic work. </p>
        
        <p> I cannot tell you the number of times I have sat to meditate - even for just a few minutes - and got frustrated that it wasn’t working. But then you know what? I sat with it - I let my thoughts do their thing. And when I stood up, I already felt calmer and more grounded. </p>
        
        <p> Meditation takes time and repeated practice to make noticeable changes. The more you practice, the more it will sneak up on you. And even if you don’t think a particular practice is working for you, try it anyway, stand up, and see how you feel. </p>
        
        <h2> Find Your Go-To Techniques </h2>
        <p> Similar to my point before - meditation is hard! But thankfully people have been meditating for thousands of years and have developed some really amazing techniques to focus the mind. No matter what tradition you choose to practice, or if you aren’t really following a distinct tradition at all - there is much to be learned from the masters. </p>
       
        <p> Start small. Even if you read some crazy techniques like sensory deprivation, or chanting mantras at 5am, it’s unlikely that these extremes will get you anywhere right away. </p>
        
         
        <p>The other thing is that many techniques may feel foreign to you at first - and that’s okay. Anything new is bound to feel awkward, maybe even silly, but give it a try. Techniques like visualization, breathing, or mantras are all useful in different ways. Most techniques help keep the mind focused on something external, to help bring awareness inwards. </p>
        <div class="image-right">

        <p> Here are a few of my personal favourites as examples: </p>
        <ul> 
        <li> <b> Alternate nostril breathing: </b> This technique involves using your fingers to block one nostril while you breathe in through the nose. You hold your inhale, then slowly breathe out of the opposite nostril. Repeat. This technique is great for balancing the breath and slowing down the heart rate. I find that focusing on the breath and the routine movement of the hand helps clear my head. </li>
        <li><b> Chanting mantras: </b>particularly on days when my mind is very busy, I need something to distract me. Mantra meditations are perfect for this. I’ve found <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7IvHNeUnsudKDgY53Z9K9S?si=7b1a28f82e3d42fd">some of my favourites</a> on Spotify. Sometimes mantras only consist of a couple of words repeated over and over, others are more elaborate. Either way, hearing my own voice is calming and grounding. And yes, I warn my partner before I start chanting in the living room! I swear he doesn’t mind.</li>
        <li> <b> Working with a mala: </b>Mala beads are more than just pretty accessories, they are actually used as a meditation aid. Most traditional malas have 108 beads, used to keep track of breaths or repeated mantras. A popular meditation is to chant om 108 times, using the mala as a guide. Keep the mala in between your hands and use the beads to count. You can also do this without chanting and just count 108 breaths. </li></ul>
            </div>
        
        <h2> Track Your Progress </h2>
        <p> Meditation has this bizarre way of sneaking up on you. Over time, you may change the way you approach difficult situations, you may feel calmer in day-to-day life, or you may be able to improve your mental health. All of these things change gradually. </p>
        <p> No one has ever meditated once and instantly become a better person. </p>
        <p> Gradual changes can be hard to notice. Because our meditation practice and our state of mind change day to day, it can be difficult to actually notice changes. That’s why tracking your progress can be a really key way to stay motivated and understand the effects of repeated meditation practice. </p>
        <p> There are different ways to track your progress. If you are more goal-oriented, you can try to set an alarm and practice at the same time each day. Use a habit tracker or some other visual to mark off each time you are able to practice. </p>
        <p> Journaling is also a great way to see the effects meditation has had on you. Sometimes I like to journal a bit about how I am feeling before a meditation practice, and then again at the end. Take note of your body sensations, your state of mind, and your emotions. </p>
        <p> You can also journal for a more long-term understanding of your practice. I like to write every few days or so about how I am feeling - whether or not it is specific to my meditation practice. Just keeping a routine journal has helped me notice changes over time in how I deal with different situations, how I respond to world events, and how I interact with others. </p>

        <h2> Meditate Both On and Off the Mat</h2>
          <p> As you build a meditation practice you will learn that many things can lead to a meditative state. Overall you will feel more mindful during day to day activities. For me, I often find myself meditating when waiting in line, when walking outside, or when making a cup of tea. As you practice, your definition of meditation becomes broader, and you start to embody a meditative state more than view meditation as an activity that you do. </p>
        <p> It's still important to set aside specific times for meditation practice. On the days you are feeling good, try new techniques, sit for longer, or treat your meditation practice more like a special event. I often incorporate meditation into my yoga practices, but I also have days when I find an extra comfy blanket, burn some incense, and focus on my meditation as the main practice. </p>
        <p> Mediation requires dedication, sustainability and honestly just a love of the journey. While it is often a useful extension to yoga or spiritual practice - it’s also super rewarding to appreciate meditation as it’s own practice as well. </p>
        </div>
        <h2> Just Start </h2>
        <p> There’s so much to be said about meditation - and I’m certainly not the only one to talk about it! Go out and learn as much as you can. Take an online course to delve deeper into the spiritual aspects of meditation. Or find resources and videos to help you learn new techniques. </p>
        <p> The biggest thing about meditation is that it takes time, it takes practice. Experiential learning is irreplaceable and it will change your experience. The more you try, the more you will have in your toolbox to meditate on the days that are a bit challenging. Try different techniques and find out what works for you. Journal so you can understand why you meditate and how it adds to your own life. Don’t take my word for it. </p>
