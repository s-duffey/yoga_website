                <p> If you ever get the chance to visit Hawaii, do it. If you don't get an excuse to go, make one up. Besides being a fantastic tropical getaway,  Hawaii is a nature lover's playground that is rich with cultural history and tradtion. For me, Hawaii was an amazing, laid-back break from the winter ice back home, but it also gave me a deep respect for nature and how to live a life in harmony with it. </p>
        
                <p> In the age of global warming, pollution crises and over consumption, I strongly believe that a deep-rooted respect for our oceans and other ecosystems is more important than ever. As beautiful as Hawaii is, I was still profoundly upset about the pieces of plastic I found along Oahu's beaches, the amount of destruction to coral reefs (like Hanauma Bay) and how certain plantations and developments have affected the landscape there.  There’s a few reasons why Hawaii was such a pivotal place to develop and deepen my respect for nature that will change how I live my life going forward. </p>
        
                <p> Here are some of the top things that contributed to that newfound respect: </p></div>
        
        
        <h2> 1.Hawaii’s awe-inspiring landscapes are unique and diverse </h2>

        <p> Especially since I visited Hawaii as a solo traveller, I had so many amazing moments of solitude surrounded by surreal landscapes. Hawaii’s diversity of ecosystems is unlike any other, with lush mountains, rain forests, coral reefs and deep sea all within reach. When it’s just you and that kind of nature, it’s impossible not to feel tiny in the presence of all that pure power. Hawaii is more than a pretty picture, the soil beneath your feet and the salty feel of the breeze gave me a whole new experience with nature that I could never get at home. Being alive and soaking in all those sensations creates such a profound respect and awe for the diversity of life on our planet. </p>
        
        <p> The diversity of all these ecosystems is unreal. Oahu alone had four different climate zones that allowed me to explore different types of greenery, beaches and wildlife. Even though there was a beach almost every two minutes down the road, it was amazing how different each one looked and felt. Hawaii is a marvel of our planet because you can experience so much of what nature has to offer in one place. </p>
        
        <p> There was one distinct moment when I was walking along a beach in Kawela Bay. I was alone and I came across a sea turtle resting on the beach. Hawaii is very particular in how tourists interact with wildlife, which is so important to different species’ preservation.  Being in the presence of such a calm but endangered creature like the sea turtle was enough to melt my heart and make me crazy about saving marine life. </p>
        
        <h2> 2. Hawaiian culture is deeply rooted in a respect and connection to the land and the sea. </h2>
        
        <p> No matter where I visit, I think it’s super important to respect and learn about the culture you’re visiting. People who live on the Hawaiian islands are quick to distinguish whether they are local or have a Hawaiian heritage. </p>
        
        <p> As a tourist, I was lucky enough to experience some authentic cultural traditions from the Hawaiin people. Hula, lei-making and a nature walk with a Hawaiian story-teller were all great experiences that gave me a taste of pre-resort Hawaii. Before visiting, I even tried to learn a little Hawaiian language. With only 13 letters in their alphabet, Hawaiian is not an easy language to learn! But learning even a little beforehand was so helpful to understand the connection to nature and family that characterizes Hawaiian culture and history. </p>
        
        <p> The nature walk was one of the highlights of my trip because it put some context to the places and natural phenomenons I was exploring. Our guide was amazing and was able to tell us stories and legends about almost every plant, landmark or animal that we passed. Even seemingly insignificant objects along our path were an important landmark and had a story or a tradition tied to it. So many of the stories had to do with humans interacting with or becoming animals or plants. It became clear to me that Hawaiian’s don’t distinguish themselves from the land where they live. We all come from nature and we are a part of it. </p>
        
        <p> This helped me realize that simply standing in nature vs. being in nature are very separate things. It’s not us versus our environment, we are part of the environment. If we destroy all the life and complex ecosystems around us, then we destroy ourselves too. </p>
        
        <h2> 3. The aloha lifestyle is all about slowing down, embracing what you can, and living within your means. </h2>
        
        <p> Because Hawaii is quite a trek to get to, it made sense that I wanted to see as much as I could in one trip. This is a natural tendency of mine anyway, but the distance and the sheer amount of different activities to do in Hawaii meant that I wanted to fill my itinerary for the trip.  It took a lot of willpower for me to make the decision to forgo island hopping and limit my trip to O’ahu. </p>
        
        <p> On my plane ride into Honolulu, I met a Hawaiian woman who hadn’t been home in ten years. She told me that no matter how much time she spent here, she couldn’t get enough. And she was 100% right - there is SO much to do in Hawaii that no length of time could let you experience everything completely. </p>
        
        <p> Even still, I jam packed my trip with activities, sightseeing and hiking. I rented a car for the first two days and ended up driving around the entire island, hopping from place to place. Some beaches I literally only walked around for 20 minutes! That defeats the relaxing part of the beach! </p>
        
        <p> By the third day, with still a yoga festival ahead of me, I was so physically and mentally exhausted that I could barely move. It was almost like all the things I had seen was too much for my brain to take in and my body was not prepared for four full days of yoga practice. </p>
        
        <p> It was a hard lesson to learn, but the aloha lifestyle is the exact opposite of what I tried to do. Eventually I HAD to slow down and it was only then that I felt like I embraced the experiences and appreciated what Hawaii had to offer. </p>
        
        <p> When presented with so many options, so many places to explore, and varying weather conditions, you have to know your limits. I was lucky to meet a dedicated surfer and nature lover early-on in my trip who told me several stories about the amazing, crazy and dangerous things that can happen when out in the water. You don’t f*ck with nature. Surfers are masters of this. No matter how strongly they may be drawn to the ocean that day, they know that some conditions are simply not safe to surf in. </p>
        
        <p> Even if they wait a week to go out, surfers will love every moment they are catching the wave. Aloha is all about being patient, being flexible and appreciating the moments you do get.This became very clear to me when I had to call off some of my planned hikes due to exhaustion or dangerous weather conditions. In every case, I was glad I did. Safety comes first and knowing your limits means its that much more important to slow down to pay attention, and to fully live the unique chances you do get. I think this such a key skill to learn when interacting with nature and when living our everyday lives in a way that is more mindful, minimal and fulfilling. </p>
        
        <h2> Loving the ocean </h2>
        
        <p> Despite not being able to explore absolutely everything O’ahu has to offer, my trip was crazy fulfilling, active and educational. Everyone who lives in Hawaii knows that saying goodbye is temporary because there’s always the chance to come back. For that reason, aloha is used to say both hello and goodbye. And even though Hawaii is way in the middle of the Pacific, I know I will get that chance. Especially if it means spending more time in nature and learning what we can do to save it. </p>

      <h3> What Yoga Teacher Training Taught Me About Web Design </h3>

<p> For the past couple years, I’ve been jet-setting solo – driving along the coast of California or snorkeling in Hawaii. This year for my summer vacation to Seattle, I decided I wanted to have a travel buddy – mostly so I could afford an Airbnb rather than sleeping on my parent’s futon...</p>

        <p> In early 2018 I took my first leap into travelling and I decided to go for it solo. Travelling is something I knew I always wanted to do but for years I was always able to find an excuse no to book my first trip. One of my biggest excuses was that I didn’t want to go alone... </p>
